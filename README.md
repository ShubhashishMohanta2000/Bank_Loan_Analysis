## 🚀 Just Completed a Data Analytics Project: Bank Customer Loan Analysis 📊

I'm excited to share my latest project where I explored a bank loan dataset to understand customer behavior and factors influencing loan approval decisions using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and created a Power BI Dashboard to visualize key insights!

## 🧠 What I Did:
✅ Imported and cleaned the data
✅ Handled outliers, missing values, and inconsistent types
✅ Performed detailed EDA using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
✅ Built a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features
✅ Analyzed key variables: Income, Age, Experience, Mortgage, CCAvg, etc.
✅ Created an interactive Power BI Dashboard for business-friendly insights
✅ Highlighted patterns in customer behavior for better decision-making

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech:
Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy)
Power BI
Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Takeaways:
Strong correlation between Income & Loan Approval
Very high correlation between Age and Experience (multicollinearity)
Mortgage has very little impact on loan approval
Target customers with high credit card usage for loan marketing

💼 This project demonstrates how data storytelling and visualization can transform raw data into valuable business insights.
